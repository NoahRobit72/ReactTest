Hello welcome to notes for developers who want to understand or continue the work we have already done 

This project was created with a React.js enviornment. There are a couple of things that need to be adressed.

1. This project uses database querries to display information on the site
    - We are using a firebase database to querry and pull information. 
    - There is plenty of documentation refer here to the set up: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart

2. In the Config.js file there Is an API key. After you have set up your firebase firestore database you should have access
   to your own custom API key. It is critical that you make this swith otherwise your querries will not be connected. 

3. Once you have your database set up you should make your first collection Called "Universities" in the Home.js file we navigate all querries and data pulls from this collection.
   ALternatively you can change the name of the first collection but you will need to go into the file to change it. 

4. Firebase is case and white space sensitive. Many of the errors we had run into were due to incorrect spellings, capitilization, or spaces unnoticed. Be mindful of this when developing.   

5. This was a first time project for two new developers still in undergrad so there are some bugs that need working out.
